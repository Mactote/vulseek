Script developed in python as a proof of concept for finding bugs through static analysis of the assembly code.

The objective is understand the logic of typical vulnerable functions.

It should be pointed out that the main idea of how to get the assembly code (using objdump), 
parse the output and find potentially vulnerable functions comes from a part of IngumaÂ´s project by Joxean Koret.
