Script developed in python as a proof of concept for finding bugs through static analysis of the assembly code.

The objective is understand the logic of typical vulnerable functions.

It´s important to point out that the main idea of how to get the assembly code (using objdump), parse the output and find probable vulnerable functions comes from a part of Inguma´s project by Joxean Koret.
